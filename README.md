# Overview
This is a simple Review classificatiom Flask app trained on Python NLTK Natural Language Processing Library

# Motivation
What could be a perfect way to utilize unfortunate lockdown period ?As I often go to the restaurant, i  am often handed a review giving sheet and only god knows what i write on that sheet at that time.They also might see that sheet as there are thousand of sheets every day,but at the end of the day ,they will have to find out the feedback about the services provided by the Restaurant.This app will help them to know about the sentiment of the review ,either it is a bad or good review
